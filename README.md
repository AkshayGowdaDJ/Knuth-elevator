# Knuth's Elevator Simulator

### About

This is a [Go](https://golang.org/) implementation of the elevator simulator described by [Donald E. Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) in *[The Art of Computer Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming)* (*TAOCP*) Volume 1.  While reading that tome, I found his example application of [doubly linked lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list) so long and ridiculous that it deserved further exploration. 

Knuthâ€™s example is a [discrete-event simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete-event_simulation) involving concurrently executing entities that interact with each other.  It demonstrates how a sorted pending-event queue and a single thread (in the case of Go, one goroutine) can imitate parallel processing.   

While that concept could have been explained with a basic, contrived system, Knuth elaborately details the elevator system in the Mathematics building of the [California Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology) across 15 pages (ignoring the exercises that follow).  And, as is the convention of *TAOCP*, the lengthy algorithm is conveyed through headache-inducing blocks of text and commented assembly language instead of pseudocode or a high-level programming language.
